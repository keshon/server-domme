# Docker Deployment

The deployment is organized with Docker Compose, allowing for simple and extended deployment options.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (if you intend to pull the source code from a Git repository)
- A Discord bot token acquired from the Discord Developer Portal

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The deployment relies on environment variables, which can be configured in the `.env` file.

#### Deployment Key Environment Variables

- `ALIAS`: Docker container name.

## Deployment

To deploy the app, run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Build and Deploy Script

For easy deployment and updates, you can use the `build-and-deploy.sh` script. This script reads the environment variables from the `.env` file and automates the build and deployment process. Run it as follows:

```bash
./build-n-deploy.sh
```
