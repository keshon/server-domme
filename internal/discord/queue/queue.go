// Package queue runs command bodies off the gateway read goroutine, in
// arrival order, one guild at a time.
//
// disgo dispatches events synchronously by default: one goroutine reads the
// socket and calls every listener inline, holding the event manager's lock
// while it does. So a command that resolves a hundred-item playlist, or opens
// a stream, held the socket unread for as long as it took -- and an
// interaction arriving in that window was answered past Discord's three-second
// acknowledgement deadline, which the user sees as "The application did not
// respond". It also made COMMAND_PARALLELISM describe a property the runtime
// did not have: commands were already serial, so the semaphore never
// contended.
//
// The gateway loop stays serial, because its ordering is load-bearing --
// Ready and GuildJoin both synchronise commands and must not interleave. What
// moves off it is the command body.
//
// Per guild rather than per command, because a guild's music is inherently
// sequential: /play and /next at the same instant have no meaningful
// interleaving, and serialising them costs nothing anybody wants. Different
// guilds run at the same time, up to the global cap this package also owns --
// lanes and cap being two halves of one question, which is how many commands
// may be running and which of them may overlap.
