// Responder is everything a command does with the one interaction it was
// invoked from. It names no library, and it is built per interaction rather
// than shared: the thing it used to take as two parameters on every call --
// a session and an event -- is what an implementation now holds.
//
// That shape is not a preference. Under discordgo an interaction reply needs
// the session and the event together, and under disgo the event answers for
// itself; a single receiver is the only shape both can satisfy, and taking
// the pair as parameters is what made this interface discordgo's.
//
// A reply is one value rather than a method per shape. There are four things
// a reply can carry -- an embed, plain content, an attachment, a row of
// buttons -- crossed with whether only the caller sees it, and naming the
// combinations is how an interface of six methods becomes one of sixteen.
// Adding a fifth thing should cost a field, not another five names.

	// ResolveDeferred removes the "thinking" placeholder when an interaction

	// Deferring posts a visible placeholder, and only editing the original

	// guild's music status message rather than replying, so its placeholder
	// had nothing to resolve it and sat there until Discord gave up on it.
