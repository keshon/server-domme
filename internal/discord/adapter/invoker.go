// Invoker is who ran a command and where, resolved once when the context is
// built rather than read back off a wire event by every accessor.
//
// Holding it as data is what lets the contexts carry no library value at all.
// The five accessors below used to reach into an interaction to answer four
// questions whose answers never change during an invocation, which meant every
// context had to keep the event that could answer them -- and a command that
// took the event instead of asking the question was one line away at all
// times. That is how phase 1 reported zero references while two dozen call
// sites still held a *discordgo.Session.
type Invoker struct {
	// GuildID is empty in a direct message.
	GuildID   string
	ChannelID string
	// UserID is UnknownUserID when the invocation carried no caller.
	UserID string
	// Username is unknownUsername, or the user ID for a reaction, when the
	// invocation carried no member.

	// Permissions is what the caller may do in this channel, as computed by
	// Discord and delivered with the invocation. PermissionsKnown says whether
	// the invocation carried them at all.
	//
	// They are carried rather than looked up because an interaction already
	// states them, channel overwrites included, and looking them up instead
	// means asking a member cache that may never have heard of this user --
	// which is a refused command rather than a wrong answer. The cache is
	// warmed by events the bot does not otherwise need, so the lookup worked
	// only for as long as the bot was told about things it had no use for.
